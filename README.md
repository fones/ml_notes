# Hello ðŸ‘‹

This is a place where I will put all my notes from videos and courses about ML.

# 2018

- In December 2018, I completed the Machine Learning course from Andrew Ng.
- Here is my [certificate](https://coursera.org/share/185362be6c01262c2ccae1e0e9a8182c) - I purchased it in 2023.
- This is where my adventure started and paused at the same time.
- I regret that I did not continue learning.

# 2023

## October

- Andrej Karpathy is my new hero ;) Check his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy)
- GTP from scrach? No problem, I started watching his [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY), but decicded to put it on hold and back to some basics.
- I have stared working on his [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) micro course
  - [E01 Micrograd](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=mHOl-irBNLws0ZOl)
    - this was fun, I like calculus so it was nice to go deep into backpropagation
    - Python is not my langauge, but going to learn it
    - NN is just a math / agebra
    - I have written NN in Matlab before, going to do the same in my favorite language JavaScript
- This article looks nice, just $25
    - ["Dynamic classification of ballistic missiles using neural networks and hidden Markov models" ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568494614000854)

## November

- I have paused a bit to catch my work @Trustisto 
- Yet again great Andrej video about LLM's [Intro to Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g)
